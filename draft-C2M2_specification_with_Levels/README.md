# The Common Fund Data Ecosystem Crosscut Metadata Model (CFDE C2M2)

This document introduces the Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2),
a flexible standard for describing biomedical experimental
data. The Common Fund Data Ecosystem group is creating a new
infrastructure , with C2M2 as its central concept, through
which powerful cross-dataset searches, custom aggregation
of experimental data and scale-powered statistical analysis
methods will be made possible for the biomedical research
community at an unprecedented scope.

## Richness Levels

In its fullest form, C2M2 is an [entity-relationship
system](../draft-CFDE_glossary/glossary.md#dummy_def)
that models some common properties of resources
fundamental to biomedical research, like samples, subjects,
files, datasets and measurement events. Essential
relationships between resources are also formally described,
documenting (for example) the samples that were processed
to produce a particular data file, or (obfuscated to
protect patient privacy) which subject a given sample was
drawn from, or .
