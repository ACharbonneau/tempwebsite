# The Common Fund Data Ecosystem Crosscut Metadata Model (CFDE C2M2)

This document introduces the Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2),
a flexible standard for describing biomedical experimental
data. The Common Fund Data Ecosystem group is creating a new
infrastructure , with C2M2 as its central concept, through
which powerful cross-dataset searches, custom aggregation
of experimental data and scale-powered statistical analysis
methods will be made possible for the biomedical research
community at an unprecedented scope.
