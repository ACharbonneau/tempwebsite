##### Metadata
A type of information entity usually defined as data about the data, understood as descriptors to understand the context of a dataset. For example, metadata about an FASTQ file may be file size or file creator. Metadata is often classified into descriptive metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata, and provenance metadata, all of which provide context to the actual data/dataset.

##### Metadata Ingest
Assigning identifiers to the objects and then extracting or creating metadata for these objects.
