X,1,subject id,dashboard,"Maybe (Amanda?) As far as I can tell, this is protected at GTEx. Not at most others. At GTEx you can get patientID + sex or sampleID + other pheotypes, but they won't tell you how patientID mps to sampleID w/o dbgap approval",,

,,"""id"" is a DCC defined id, a local id",,,,
,,,,,,
,,"Level 0 is just a list of files, in some sense, a manifest",,,,
Notes,,"Level 1 is, by definition, enough to instantiate a valid C2M2 instance and support some use cases",,,,
,,Level 2 is sufficient to support substantial portal use cases,"basic metadata related to the <subject id, sample id>",,,
,,Level 3 is sufficient to support most portal and analysis use cases,,,,
,,we will populate the effort estimate column as we learn by prototyping with HMP. We want to be able to tell a DCC how much effort they'll need to produce data at a given level,,,,

,,Is there a MIME TYPE concern? Could data type and file format be collapsed into some new MIME TYPE thing?,,,,
