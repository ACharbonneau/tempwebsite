Required to support use cases planned for June demo?,Level,data item,component,restricted?,effort estimate,comment
Y,0,id_namespace,"dashboard,portal",,,Identifier assigned by CFDE to a top-level data collection (simplest instance of 'top-level data collection': the collection of things owned by one DCC). To be used in combination with 'id' as a compound key structure.
Y,0,id,dashboard,,,"Unrestricted-format object identifier assigned by DCC. For Level-0 metadata submissions to the C2M2 database, 'object' means 'file'; for metadata submissions at Levels 1 and up, 'object' can mean any C2M2 entity ('file', 'subject', 'bio_sample', etc.). To be used in combination with 'id_namespace' as a compound key structure."
Y,0,size_in_bytes,dashboard,,,"[Editing note: The corresponding field in the file entity will need renaming (from ""length"") in the full C2M2 model spec.]"
Y' (one of 'sha256' or 'md5' is required but not both),0,sha256,,,,preferred file checksum string [Editing note: this needs to be added to the full C2M2 file entity.]
Y' (one of 'sha256' or 'md5' is required but not both),0,md5,,,,acceptable file checksum string
Y,0,uri ,,,,"a persistent URI generated by a DCC (using, e.g., our minid server) and attached to a file, to serve as both (a) a mechanism for consistently tracking the same file over time, independently of changeable contextual details like 'PATH location' or even 'filename' (i.e. renaming a file shouldn't change its identity), and (b) as a permanent address to which landing pages and other relevant decorations can be (eventually) attached to a file, including (optionally) resolution to a retrievable network location. Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier. [Editing note: This will replace 'location' in the full C2M2 file entity.]"
Y,0,filename,,,,a filename with no prepended PATH information.
Y,1,file_format (EDAM),"dashboard, portal",,,
Y,1,data_type (EDAM),"dashboard, portal",,,[Editing note: this wil replace 'information_type' in the full C2M2 file entity.]
Y,1,assay_type (OBI),"dashboard, portal",,,[Editing note: this will replace 'sample_type' in the C2M2 'bio_sample' entity.]
Y,1,host_species (NCBI Taxonomy),"dashboard, portal",,,"[Editing note: this will be added to the C2M2 'bio_sample' entity, and linked via a new association to the ncbi_taxonomy_db table.]"
Y,1,anatomy (Uberon),"dashboard, portal",,,
Y,1,project,dashboard,,,"A PATH-like fwdslash (""/"")-delimited string, where the sequence of /-delimited substrings describes the project containment hierarchy attached to a file, subject or sample. DCCs will (optionally) generate these strings in whatever way they see fit (as long as delimited tokens don't contain slash characters). Note in particular that there is no default assumption of any relationship whatsoever between the project hierarchy proffered by a DCC in its data submission (via this field) and any formal NIH project structure: in other words, DCCs are free to subdivide their project space however they like at this level, and stuff it in this field as a PATH. (More structured [and programmatically usable] modeling of organizations, projects and studies associated with C2M2 core entities will be specified in the full C2M2 model, but is not required for Level 1 compliance.) [Editing note: this will be added as a property to C2M2 'bio_sample', 'file' and 'subject' entities. I don't think we need to put it anywhere else, but I'm open to correction there. -AB]"
Y,1,subject id,dashboard,"Maybe (Amanda?) As far as I can tell, this is protected at GTEx. Not at most others. At GTEx you can get patientID + sex or sampleID + other pheotypes, but they won't tell you how patientID mps to sampleID w/o dbgap approval",,"[Editing note: this maps to the 'id' field in the C2M2 'subject' entity and will be encoded as such in a compliant data submission. Its presence here along with 'sample_id' means that a compliant Level 1 data submission will support the construction of an association table linking subjects and samples. Note in particular that subject_id can be remapped by a DCC to preserve phenotype-data protection like Amanda describes in her note here: for example, GTEx could create a new set of identifiers for its patients, attach those identifiers to its samples, and thus avoid sharing any connections between patient_id-associated phenotype data and the sample metadata.]"
Y,1,sample id,dashboard,,,[Editing note: this maps to the 'id' field in the C2M2 'bio_sample' entity and will be encoded as such in a compliant data submission. Its presence here along with 'subject_id' means that a compliant Level 1 data submission will support the construction of an association table linking subjects and samples.]

,2,age,portal,"Restricted access (??) at GTEx, not at KF",,
,2,disease,portal,Restricted access (??) I actually think this might be open,,AB comment: This and the following entries in this section all sound like arrays or sets. Is that right? Or does each entry stand for a bunch of distinct but related (optional) fields?
,2,"health conditions (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyper-thyroidism, etc)",,Restricted access,,HC comment: I would move this to Level 3
,2,medication,,Restricted access,,HC comment: I would move this to Level 3
,2,"vital stats (height, weight, bp)",,Restricted access,,
,2,visit info,,Restricted access,,"eg date, timepoint"
,3,sequencing technology,,,,

Notes,,"For EDAM, OBI, and other ontologies or taxonomies, need to define validation process (am drafting a sketch proposal for this, to be included in the C2M2-with-levels spec document I'm preparing -AB)",,,,
,,,,,,
,,"Specifically how should the effort estimate column be populated (as we learn by prototyping with HMP)? Some kind of abstract scale, 1-10? Some other measure? (column purpose: We want to be able to tell a DCC how much effort they'll need to produce data at a given level)",,,,
,,,,,,
,,"The ""full"" C2M2 model, in this context, is going to represent the highest-level superset model that contains everything described in all the levels. Levels 2 and 3 aren't done being drafted yet (also note that there's no clean 1-to-1 relationship at present between what's listed here for levels 2 and 3 and the C2M2 entities' properties), so we're not making any changes to the model for that range of data richness right now, but this note should serve as a placeholder noting that as soon as we have everything nailed down at those levels (and any other levels that get added on top), the ""full C2M2"" ER diagram and accompanying frictionless spec will need to be altered to match.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,"Level 0 is just a list of files, in some sense, a manifest",,,,
,,Level 1 is enough to instantiate a C2M2 instance containing minimal inter-entity relationships (like linking samples to subjects) and support some use cases,,,,
,,Level 2 is sufficient to support substantial portal use cases,"basic metadata related to the <subject id, sample id>",,,
,,Level 3 is sufficient to support most portal and analysis use cases,,,,
